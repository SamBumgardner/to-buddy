The purpose of this thread is to keep all match setup (pinging your opponents, picking a spot to play, etc.) in here.

This keeps the main channel clear for general tournament chatter, announcements, and any important questions that come up along the way.

Quick reminder, but by default ALL off-stream games should be played in the Park `USA West Coast #41`.

@Strive Showdown Please use this channel to track down your opponents for games. 

I'll ping folks in "lb-stream-coordination" or "wb-stream-coordination" if you're going to play on stream, otherwise you're good to play off stream when I give the round-start announcement
