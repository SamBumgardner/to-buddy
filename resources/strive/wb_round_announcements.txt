Winners' Bracket round-start announcements will get posted here (will ping everyone present in the thread). 

The Losers' Bracket is always good to run as soon as your match is ready, so feel free to leave / mute this thread if you end up there.

We'll use this thread to signal when winners' bracket rounds can start playing. 

Please don't start playing your rounds until we give the signal here.
