`When / Where to play`
Winners' Bracket games should always wait to play until you've confirmed if you are playing on-stream or not.

As a general rule, Losers' Bracket games should play off-stream as soon as they're ready **UNTIL reaching top 8** (at that point, please check with me to see what the plan is). We'll be running a second stream for some of our Losers' Bracket games again this week, check the end of this rules thread for details on how your match can show up there! 

Streamed Winners' Bracket (and finals) matches will be played in a lobby hosted by Jordain. See pinned messages in the main channel for the room code. I'll post messages with all of the relevant information included to "winners-round-start" whenever we're kicking off the next round of matches, so keep an eye out for those.

Non-streamed matches should be played in Park `US West Coast #41` - keeping everyone in one spot will hopefully cut down on the time we usually spend tracking each other down and navigating the lovely park/lobby system. If this presents a problem for you, please let the TO know so we can discuss alternative options.
==========
`Match Reporting`
Please report match results directly into the Challonge bracket (https://challonge.com/23ypeetc). Please DM me your results if you run into any issues with that process, I'll take care of it in those cases.
==========
`Connectivity`
Our goal is to offer a relatively relaxed tournament that can include as many folks as possible. With that in mind, we don't have any hard requirements for the quality of each player's internet connection. Not every connection is going to be ideal, unfortunately, but hopefully everything is reasonably playable.

Our preferred standard is for every player has an upload speed above 5 Mbps and jitter under 6 ms. Connections can be checked at https://speed.cloudflare.com/ 

In the case of serious, unplayable connection issues, please notify notify the TO right away. The TO will ask both players to submit a screenshot of their results from the connection test linked above; the winner will be determined at the TO's discretion according to connection quality, or by coin flip if necessary.
==========
`Missing Opponents`
If you have trouble contacting your Winners' Bracket opponent within ~5 minutes of the round starting (after I've posted my message announcing streamed matches) let me know and I'll help track down your opponent.

When playing through Losers' Bracket, please send your next opponent a ping in this channel after entering your results into the bracket - you can get game location and such sorted out from there (reminder: generally play in Park `US West Coast #41`, but optionally play in the LB stream room). If you don't hear back from your opponent in ~5 minutes after your ping (or if you can't find their discord name in the first place) please let me know and I'll help track them down.

Let's keep the bracket running smoothly so we can all spend more time playing and less time waiting!
==========
`LOSERS' BRACKET STREAM INFO`
Having your match played on stream and commentated is pretty cool, right? 

We're going to keep running a setup to get Losers' bracket matches throughout the tournament on-stream at https://twitch.tv/catboygg, thanks to the efforts of `@Catboy` and `@Ash!! (they/them)`!

`How To Get On Stream`
For this week, our plan is pretty simple. Play your losers' bracket matches as soon as they're ready as usual, but instead of meeting up in the `US West Coast #41` park, join Catboy's streaming lobby (listed in the pinned messages, alongside Jordain's winners' bracket stream lobby code)

Catboy will be wandering around the room, spectating and commentating matches as they happen to be available. It may seem a little chaotic, but plan on playing your matches as usual and everything will work out fine. The lobby's set up to have players step off of their stations after each game in their set, so even if the streamers miss the first part of the set they have a chance to hop on and spectate games 2 & 3.

NOTE:
Please drop out of the room when you aren't setting up a match, and avoid joining the room if you see it's already at capacity. We'd like to keep a rotating pool of folks in there so more people have a chance to be on stream!

`Q: Should I wait to play my games until Catboy has time to spectate?`
*No*, please don't wait. 

**Our first priority is still to keep the brackets running as smoothly as possible so the tournament can finish in a timely fashion.**

If you're tuned into Catboy's stream and can see he's hunting for a match to spectate, you can drop a message in his chat to let him know that you're ready. If he's in any part of an ongoing match, however, please just keep playing your matches as normal.
